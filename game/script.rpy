 scene 623 with dissolve
 e "You have no idea. Cheerleading has always been my outlet."
 e "How much has [g1] told you about her past? Like about our family?"
 mcf "Not much. She doesn't like talking about it. All I know is that your dad hasn't been a great father."
 e "That's quite an understatement. I'd hardly call him a father."
 e "He would call us sluts, ugly, unlovable. Anything mean you can think of, he's said to us."
 e "That led to a lot of anger. In both me and [g1]."
 e "I let all that build up and I wasn't a happy kid. That was until I found cheer."
 e "It let me express myself and get rid of a bunch of that anger and hurt."
 e "I remember my first time cheering at an actual game."
 e "I was standing on the sideline. Minding my own business doing my best to look like I belonged. Then out of nowhere a giant comes crashing into me and knocks me to the floor."
 e "I felt so embarrassed. I remember my face getting so hot and just wanting to lay on the ground and try to be invisible."
 mcf "I'm still sorry about that. I lost my balance diving for a ball going out of bounds."
 scene 624 with dissolve
 e "That's when you picked me up and brought me over to the team's doctor to make sure I was okay."
 e "An act like that to a girl that was in the mindset I was in was nothing short of god like."
 e "After that I fell in love with cheer. I loved being at your games and seeing you win in the ways you have. It's everything I've ever wanted for you."
 e "I know I've given you and [g1] a lot of grief growing up. I don't know why I did."
 e "Well actually I do, it was for attention. Me and [g1] both didn't get much as children. So I guess we just crave for it now."
 mcf "That explains why [g1] has been acting the way she has the past few days."
 e "That girl loves you. Everytime she was with you she would come home with a huge smile."
 e "I've even caught her reading books on how to be the perfect girlfriend. She even does the thing where you're her phone background and she writes your name all over her notebooks."
 e "She even says your name in her sleep. She's crazy about you and I'm happy she has you to make her happy."
 e "The reason I'm saying all that is because cheer is my you. It makes me happy, I study it, and it's all I think about."
 e "Cheer was everything I needed growing up. It gave me confidence and strength when I had none."
 e "I would love for that to continue here. I want to cheer you on especially. But I understand why you can't do this."
 mcf "I don't understand. They say they're doing all of this to make me happy but all I want is for you to be able to do what you want to do unbridled by my decisions."
 e "Have you met the uni president?"
 mcf "No, not yet."
 e "The man thinks the world runs on sex. In his eyes sex is the problem and the solution."
 e "He thinks if I can't please you in this way how can I be worthy of cheering for you?"
 mcf "That's completely asinine. You deserve to cheer here. I've never seen you miss a practice or let your squad down."
 e "I had a great guy to look up to in that way."
 mcf "You shouldn't be nude in any basement. You're a beautiful woman who is better than this."
 e "Cheer is all I have. I don't have any friends and my sister hates me."
 mcf "First off, we're friends. And about your sister, It doesn't have to be that way. College can be a fresh start."
 mcf "The things you said about your father, she went through that too. She could have used a big sister like you to help her through it."
 e "You don't have a clue how awful I feel about the way I've treated her."
 mcf "I'm sure she regrets a lot of things she's said about you too. You two need to sit down and hash it out."

 g1 "You're this larger than life man who has every girl in this school going crazy for him."
 g1 "And I'm just the dork who was lucky enough to be your science partner."
 g1 "I might make you happy now, but what if we get into a fight? What if one day you just don't feel the same?"

 mcf "[g1].. I just want your first time to be special. It has nothing to do with any of that."
 g1 "I know, it's just in my dream world you wouldn't have been able to resist. You would have wanted me so bad that you'd be willing to do it anywhere."
 g1 "And last night when I tried, you pulled me off of you. I know you want it to be special."
 g1 "But I just want you. It could be anywhere. Our first kiss was special and I think about it everyday and it was just on your couch after school one day."
 g1 "I love you and how thoughtful you are. But I really, really just want you. It could be anywhere and it would be special."

 mcf "[g1], you have no clue how badly I want you. You have no clue the lengths I would go to make sure you were happy."

 g1 "That's when I saw her go into the bathroom where you were showering. I heard her confess her feelings to you."
 mcf "Babe.."
 g1 "Hey, hey. You said you would let me finish."
 g1 "I'm not mad. I heard you tell her exactly what you would tell me. To get it off her chest."
 g1 "You made her feel safe in the most uncomfortable position. But.. I didn't realize that at the time."
 g1 "I was too scared to hear what you would say to her. So I ran back to your living room."
 g1 "I knew she had to have feelings for you. After how she talked about you and everything. I wanted her to tell me that. That's what I was trying to get out of that boy talk."
 g1 "I was just scared because in that moment I was afraid she would take you from me."
 g1 "I told your mom everything. She was the only one I could talk to about it."

 g1 "I'm lucky enough to be yours. You come home to me at night."
 g1 "But I know I'm not perfect. There's plenty of girls who can do things better than me."
 g1 "But no girl will ever want to see you happy like I do."
 g1 "So what I'm getting at is... You should be with Shauna too. And more."
 mcf "[g1]. You have to drop this notion that you aren't everything I need."
 g1 "It's not just that. Other girls need you. You have this uncanny talent for being exactly what someone needs."
 g1 "Your mom helped me understand that."
 mcf "[am] told you that we should be in a poly relationship?"
 g1 "Not exactly, but that's what I realized was right. Shauna needs you [mcf]."
 g1 "Others girls do too, so I'm giving you a deal."
 g1 "You're free to be with anyone that deserves you. Girls that are kind and sweet and want good for you. Like Stacy."
 g1 "You don't have to tell me about them, I'd prefer not to know."
 g1 "But if you ever develop true feelings for them and want them to be a constant part of your life, I'd like to know and I would like to have a say in it."
 mcf "I don't even know what to say babe."
 g1 "I know it's a lot but it's what I truly want. I was just a dork with a laundry list of problems before you came in my life."
 g1 "You've not only fixed all of those problems, you made me a better person and you've made me fall in love."

 mcf "All right, I can't even wrap my head around this right now. I never thought you'd be the one to be into an open relationship."
 g1 "Me neither. But I am now. And just to clarify, I'm only yours. No other man can ever compare to you."
